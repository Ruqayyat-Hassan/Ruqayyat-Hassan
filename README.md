- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ruqayyat-Hassan
- 👀 I’m interested in Healthcare Data Analysis and Data Science
- 🌱 I completed a course on Data Analysis and now my goal is to improve on what I have learnt so far by practicing my use of SQL, Excel, PowerBI software and also learning R and Python programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data projects: Guided, Solo, Group or Hackathons
- 📫 You can reach me on [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruqayyat-hassan-182609303) or [X](https://x.com/mademoiselle_RH)
- ⚡ Fun fact: The things that I find challenging at first, eventually become my favourite things to indulge in and excel at.
